# schedual-days

##  Description

The motivation of this project was to create a working schedual that allows a person to write things to do along with it saving on the set times.This was to help me build a feature that would allow it possible to save things on the page. Along with sovling the problem of helping anyone who needed a page that saved things they needed done and would remind them of what time it would start. What I have learned in this project was the the feature of how to save items on a page for future projects.
